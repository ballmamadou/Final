    <h1 class="article-title">NBA Weekly Breakdown — Rising Teams & Major Storylines</h1>

    <p class="article-date">Updated: December 2025</p>

    <p>
      The 2025–26 NBA season is well underway, and the early weeks have already created
      major headlines across the league. From unexpected risers to veteran teams finding
      new life, the landscape is shifting fast as December matchups heat up.
    </p>

    <h2>Thunder Start Hot as Shai Looks Like an MVP Again</h2>
    <p>
      The Oklahoma City Thunder continue their accelerated rise, opening the season
      with strong defensive efficiency and balanced scoring across their young core.
      Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s early-season play is drawing MVP chatter, while
      Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren give OKC one of the most cohesive young units
      in the league.
    </p>

    <h2>Knicks Stay Afloat Behind Josh Hart</h2>
    <p>
      New York entered December with key injuries, but Josh Hart has stepped into an
      expanded role and delivered. His recent 20-point, 12-rebound, 7-assist performance
      helped secure a crucial win and keep the Knicks competitive in the East.
    </p>

    <h2>Warriors Reignite Offense with Seth Curry Return</h2>
    <p>
      Golden State surprised fans by bringing Seth Curry back to the Bay. His immediate
      impact as a shooter has opened the floor for Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, and
      early results hint that Golden State may have more left in the tank than expected.
    </p>

    <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      The Western Conference is deeper than ever, while pivotal Eastern teams fight to
      stay consistent. As December progresses, health, depth, and roster adjustments will
      determine which teams enter 2026 trending upward.
